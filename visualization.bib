abstract = "More than 30 students from university campus participated in the Development of Biomedical Image Processing Software Package for New Learners Survey investigating the use of software package for processing and editing image. The survey was available online for six months. Facts and opinions were sought to learn the general information, interactive image processing tool, non-interactive (automatic) tool, current status and future of image processing package tool. Composed of 19 questions, the survey built a comprehensive picture of the software package, programming language, workflow of the tool and captured the attitudes of the respondents. Result shows that MATLAB was difficult to use but it was viewed in high regard however. The result of this study is expected to be beneficial and able to assist users on effective image processing and analysis in a newly developed software package."
